In Week 4 Programming Day, students practiced solving real-life problems using 
conditional statements, arithmetic logic, and user-input handling in C++. 
This week focused on building decision-making skills through scenarios like 
airline discounts, challan verification, temperature comparison, flower shop
billing, and Tom’s yearly playtime calculation. Students also explored 
classification using speed-level logic, area calculations of different 
geometric shapes, and number-to-text conversion. These exercises strengthened
logical thinking, improved problem-solving, and helped students apply 
if/else structures effectively in practical programming tasks.
