In Week 3 Programming Day, students practiced writing C++ programs that process
user input and perform calculations based on real-life scenarios. 
Tasks included geometry calculations, velocity, weight loss, video frame counts,
and financial computations. Students developed skills in handling user input, 
applying arithmetic operations, using modulus operator, and performing complex 
multi-step calculations. Through these exercises, they learned to implement 
logical processing, understand program flow, and create functional, 
user-interactive programs. 
This session strengthened problem-solving abilities and enhanced their confidence
in applying C++ fundamentals practically.
