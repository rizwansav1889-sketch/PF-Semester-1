In Lab 4, students explored the fundamental concepts of conditional statements 
in C++ using if and if-else constructs. 
This lab focused on logical decision-making and problem-solving by simulating 
real-life scenarios such as purchasing decisions, attendance checks, and 
personalized greetings. Students practiced evaluating conditions, comparing values, 
and executing different blocks of code based on Boolean expressions. 
Through hands-on examples and challenges, they learned to validate input, 
perform calculations, and implement multiple conditions effectively.
By completing this lab, students developed the ability to write programs that 
respond intelligently to different situations, enhancing both their programming 
skills and logical thinking abilities.
