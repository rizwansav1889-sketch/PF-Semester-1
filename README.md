Programming Fundamentals – Semester 1 (UET Lahore)

Author: Rizwan Ansir
Instructor: Sir Waseem
Semester: 1st

Introduction

Welcome to my Programming Fundamentals (PF) repository for the 1st semester at UET Lahore.
I am Rizwan Ansir, and throughout this semester, I have explored and practiced the core 
concepts of programming using C++. This repository includes all my exercises from weekly 
Programming Day tasks, lab assignments, and mini-projects designed to strengthen logical 
thinking, problem-solving, and coding skills.

Repository Overview

The repository contains:

Weekly Programming Day Exercises:

      Concepts like loops (while, for), conditional statements (if-else, switch), functions, 
      arrays, strings, and file handling.
      Simple to complex programs, gradually increasing in difficulty to enhance understanding.

Lab Assignments:

Labs for each week include tasks on arrays, strings, mathematical operations, and problem-solving
challenges.
Includes both Work Problems (WP) and Class Problems (CP) with step-by-step solutions.

Mini-Projects:

Vehicle Rental Management System: A simple system with admin and customer functionalities to manage,
book, and return vehicles.
Games and Other Programs: Programs demonstrating array manipulations, loops, file handling, and 
interactive console-based applications.

Key Concepts Covered :

Conditional and counter loops (while, for)

Arrays (declaration, initialization, operations)

Strings and character arrays

Functions (user-defined, parameterized)

File handling for reading and storing data

Problem-solving using C++ fundamentals

Conclusion

This repository demonstrates my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and their applications in solving real-world and academic problems. The programs are designed using basic C++ constructs, providing a foundation for more advanced programming projects in future semesters.
